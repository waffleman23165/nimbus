// Minimal Supabase Realtime client — enough to run a partner flowing session,

//
// Supabase Realtime is a Phoenix channels server. The wire protocol is small
// and stable, so this speaks it directly instead of pulling in
// @supabase/supabase-js (~200KB + deps) for the one feature we use. That also
// matches how `auth.svelte.ts` already talks to the same project with raw
// fetch rather than the SDK.
//
// What this is used for: BROADCAST only. No database tables, no schema, no
// migrations — a channel is just a name, and the server relays messages
// between whoever joined it. Nothing about a flow is ever stored server-side.
//
// ⚠ This is NOT on the launch path and must never become so. A partner session
// is something you opt into from inside a flow; every failure here has to
// degrade to "you are flowing alone", never to a broken app.

 * Two partners can never settle on different relays, because each only
 * settles on the one it actually heard the other on.
 *
 * Mid-session, if the relay is lost for good (switched off, or refusing the

 * from the relay — starts listening there too and follows. Either move is
