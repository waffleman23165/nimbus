// Partner flowing: two people, one flow, over a Supabase Realtime broadcast
// channel. See `realtime.ts` for the transport.
//
// ── The rules this file exists to keep ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. SOLO FLOWING IS UNTOUCHED. Nothing here runs until you start or join a
//    session. With no session there is no diff loop, no socket, no listener.
//
// 2. EACH PARTNER WRITES THEIR OWN FILE, ALWAYS. Two clients autosaving one
//    Dropbox file is the exact shape of the 2026-08-24 data loss. A session
//    syncs CONTENT between two local copies; it never shares a path.
//
// 3. DELTAS ARE KEYED ON ROW ID, NEVER ROW INDEX. The moment either side
//    inserts a row every index below it shifts, and an index-addressed edit
//    would land on the wrong argument.
//
// 4. THE FLOW IS NEVER STORED SERVER-SIDE. A channel is a relay. Nothing about
//    a round is persisted by Supabase.
//
// ── Known limitation, deliberate ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Undo is snapshot-based (`pushHistory` stringifies the WHOLE round), so an
// undo taken after your partner typed would restore a snapshot that predates
// their work and silently delete it. Until undo is rewritten to inverse
// patches, receiving a remote change CLEARS THE UNDO STACK. Undo is therefore
// short-lived during a live session. That is a real cost, chosen over the
// alternative, which is destroying your partner's flow.
